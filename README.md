# Academic Projects — Tareq Aldirawi

A collection of statistical analysis projects in biostatistics and pharmaceutical data science, with a focus on conformal prediction, multiple hypothesis testing, and survival analysis.

## Projects

### 1. [Multiple Hypothesis Testing for Gene Expression Analysis](gene-expression-fdr/)
**Tools:** R, Bioconductor, FDR Control

Identifies significant biomarkers from 7,129 gene expressions while controlling the false discovery rate at 5%. Compares Bonferroni, Benjamini-Hochberg, and Storey's q-value correction methods on the Golub leukemia microarray dataset.

---

### 2. [Conformal Prediction for Survival Analysis](conformal-survival/)
**Tools:** R, Statistical Inference

Constructs individual-level survival prediction intervals with 95% guaranteed coverage on lung cancer data. Implements split conformal and full conformal methods on Cox proportional hazards models with comparison to naive parametric intervals.

---

### 3. [Parametric and Semi-Parametric Survival Modeling](survival-modeling/)
**Tools:** R, SAS

Compares Weibull, Log-Normal, Log-Logistic, and Cox PH models for survival prediction. Includes concordance index evaluation, calibration plots, Schoenfeld residual diagnostics, and model selection via AIC/BIC.
